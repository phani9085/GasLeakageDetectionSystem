"Gas Leakage Detection System". This project involved designing an IoT-based system that uses gas sensors to detect harmful gas leaks in real-time. The system was programmed to send alerts to users via buzzera sound when dangerous gas concentrations are detected. The project utilized platforms such as Arduino, ensuring safety and quick response to potential hazards.
